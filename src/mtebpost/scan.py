Reads merged PRs from the mteb and results repos via `gh`, classifies them by title
convention, and pairs each model addition with its results PR. Output is a list of
candidates — *not* drafts. A candidate is a claim that something happened and a guess at
why it might matter; deciding whether it is postable is the next stage's job.

Two things this deliberately does not do:

* **It does not judge.** Everything merged in the window shows up, including the bug
  fixes and refactors that will obviously be rejected. Filtering here would hide the
  denominator — you could no longer see what the pipeline chose not to say.
* **It does not trust labels.** Roughly half the genuine model additions carry no label
  at all, and `jina-reranker-v3.5` carried `new model` while being pure plumbing.
  Classification keys off the title conventions the repos actually use
  (`model:`, `task:`, `[MOEB]`, `fix:`, `ci:`), which are far more consistent.

The pairing heuristic is crude: it looks for distinctive words from the model PR title
appearing inside the results PR title. It will miss pairs and occasionally invent one,
which is why every candidate records both PR numbers for a human to check rather than
asserting the pairing as fact.

Running it twice is safe. Anything whose trigger PR already appears anywhere in the
pipeline — including in `rejected/` — is skipped, so a rejected candidate stays rejected
instead of being re-proposed the next morning.
