"""Render a post's card HTML to PNG.

    uv run visuals/render.py --card posts/<id>/card-1-<slug>.html --out posts/<id>/card-1-<slug>.png
    uv run visuals/render.py --card posts/<id>/card-1-<slug>.html --mode dark --out /tmp/preview.png

The card is self-contained: `fetch.py` writes its numbers into the `#card-data` block,
and the copy lives in a `COPY` object beside it. So opening `card.html` in a browser
shows exactly what this produces — there is no separate data file that can drift from
the checked-in markup.

The only thing injected at render time is `mode`, merged into the existing card data
rather than replacing it, so dark and light come from one file.

Alt text is read back out of the rendered page (`window.__altText`) and written into the
card itself as `<script type="text/plain" id="alt-text">`. So it stays generated from the
same data that drew the image — it cannot disagree with the picture — while remaining
readable by anything that can parse HTML, with no browser required at publish time.

There is deliberately no `.txt` sidecar. A derived file next to a source file is a file
that drifts; the card already carries its own data and copy, and the alt text belongs
there for the same reason.

`--mode dark` is for previewing: only one image can be posted, so the light render is
the artifact and a dark PNG would just be a second copy of the same numbers.

Uses the locally installed Chrome via Playwright's `channel="chrome"`, so there is no
browser download. Chrome's `--screenshot` CLI flag is deliberately not used: it hangs
on macOS in both the old and new headless modes.
