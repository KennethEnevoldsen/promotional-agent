"""Check posts against the rules a machine can check.

This covers the mechanical rules only — 300 characters, required fields per stage, files
that must exist, dates that must be consistent. It cannot tell you whether a post is
worth publishing, whether a cohort is fair, or whether a claim is scoped correctly. Those
are in CONTRIBUTING.md and they need a person.

The split matters: a check that runs is worth more than a rule that is merely written
down, but a passing run says only that nothing obvious is broken.
