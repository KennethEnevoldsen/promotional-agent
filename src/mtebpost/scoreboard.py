"""Pull benchmark scores and size-peer context out of the MTEB results repo.

Shared by the per-post `fetch.py` scripts. Each post folder keeps its own thin
fetch script naming the exact models, benchmark and peer band it used, so the
provenance of every number in a post is one file away from the post itself.

Two deliberate choices:

* Aggregation goes through `Benchmark.get_score()`, the same path the leaderboard
  uses. We never average task scores by hand — if MTEB changes how a benchmark
  aggregates, these numbers follow automatically instead of quietly diverging.
* Peers are selected by **active** parameters, not total. For models with a large
  shared embedding table the two differ by more than an order of magnitude
  (Bekko a8m: 7.7M active, 106M total), and active is what determines inference
  cost per token.
