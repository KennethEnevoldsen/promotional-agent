"""Cohort selection and chart-shape recommendation for `model_addition` posts.

Every model-release post answers the same three questions before it can pick a card:
who are the fair peers (full task coverage, same benchmark — CONTRIBUTING.md's
"complete task coverage only" rule), does the subject sit on a size/score Pareto
frontier, and if not, is there one clear rival worth a head-to-head. Answering those
by hand, differently each time, is most of the bespoke work in every model_addition
`fetch.py` so far (see bekko-thread, dinghy-law-family, colvec11-vidore,
mdenseon-mlateon) — this module answers them once, on top of `leaderboard_api.py`.

The three answers map onto the three card shapes already proven in production:

- **pareto** — scatter, size vs score, frontier shaded (bekko card-1-frontier).
- **radar** — one spoke per task type (or per task, for a domain-narrow cohort),
  subject against one named rival (bekko card-2-tasks).
- **bars** — ranked list, subject(s) highlighted (colvec11-vidore, dinghy-law-family,
  mdenseon-mlateon). The default: always defensible, no story required.

`recommend_chart()` is advice, not a silent decision — a `fetch.py` prints the
reasoning and still writes exactly one card, chosen by whoever is drafting the post.
Overriding it is normal, not a bug: the heuristic cannot see whether a "radar-eligible"
rival is actually the comparison worth making (CONTRIBUTING's "one post, one claim").

Runs entirely on `leaderboard_api` (the live leaderboard-backend), not the local `mteb`
library. The local package is version-pinned for reproducibility (pyproject.toml's
`exclude-newer`), so it has no `ModelMeta` for anything registered after that pin
date — in practice most freshly-registered models, which is exactly the subject of a
model_addition post. The API is also just faster: no ~190s import, no per-model local
result load.

    retrieval (MTEB subset)") — without it, four or more tasks fall back to "N tasks",
    which is accurate but says nothing a reader can picture. Ignored when `benchmark`
    is already a registered name.

    `benchmark` is either a registered name ("MTEB(Multilingual, v2)") or an explicit
    task list — the latter for a subject whose own results don't cover a full
    registered benchmark (a fine-tune evaluated on a hand-picked domain slice, the
    common case for a smaller lab's release). Either way scoring is Mean(Task), the
    same unweighted aggregation `Benchmark.get_score()` uses, so the "full coverage"
    rule still applies — just scoped to the tasks actually run rather than stretched to
    a benchmark nobody submitted to.

    `subsets` maps a task name to the one subset that counts for it — needed for any
    multi-language task in an explicit task list (XMarket -> "de", say), since the API
    reports no aggregate score for a model that ran fewer than every subset a task has.

    `max_active` bands peers by size instead of comparing the whole field — like
    bekko's frontier. A Pareto claim needs the band: almost everything is smaller than
    the largest model on any board, so "smaller and just as good" is only a claim a
    size-restricted cohort can support.

    `min_languages > 1` on a multilingual benchmark keeps English-only peers out — they
    score low because they were never built for the task, which both flatters the
