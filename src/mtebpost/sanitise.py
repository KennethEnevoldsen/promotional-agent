"""Clean contributor prose before any of it reaches a model.

PR bodies and model cards are the richest input the pipeline has and they are entirely
attacker-controlled (AGENTS.md #3). Merging a PR does not review them: a reviewer approves
a *diff*, and the description is not part of it — on GitHub it stays editable by the
author after the merge, with nobody looking again. So "it was merged" buys a reviewed
change and an unreviewed, still-mutable body, and the body is the part we feed a model.

This is defence in depth, not the defence. What actually keeps an injection harmless is
structural: the model is never asked for a number, so an injected figure cannot reach a
post; contributor prose is fenced and labelled as data; and nothing a drafter writes can
publish without passing review and acquiring a named `approved_by`. This file only closes
the gap where the attacker's text is invisible to the human doing that reviewing.

Which is the point of `findings`: everything removed is reported, never silently dropped.
A stripped comment that nobody hears about is an attempted attack nobody counted, and the
same author trying twice is the signal worth having.
