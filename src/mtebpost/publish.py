"""Show, and optionally send, a scheduled post.

    uv run mteb-publish                       # show anything due today
    uv run mteb-publish --date 2026-08-03     # a specific day
    uv run mteb-publish --all                 # the whole queue
    uv run mteb-publish --send                # actually post it to Bluesky

Without --send this only prints, and needs no credentials.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A BROWSER. The text and the alt come straight out of post.md, so
what is published is byte-for-byte what was reviewed — there is no retyping step for a
number to change in. It is also the same path a scheduler would use, so a manual run
today exercises tomorrow's automation instead of being a throwaway.

CREDENTIALS. --send reads BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD from the environment and nothing else.
Use a Bluesky *app password* (Settings -> Privacy and Security -> App Passwords), never
the account password: app passwords are revocable and cannot change account settings or
delete the account. It is never written to disk or logged by this script.

WHAT --send REFUSES TO DO. It will not post something that is not in 4-scheduled, not
approved by a named human, or not dated today. Those are the pipeline's guarantees, and
a publish path that can bypass them is a publish path that eventually does.

DISCLOSURE. Running this by hand keeps the account at the Handheld tier: a person still
decides that a post goes out now. Automating the *trigger* — cron, a scheduler — is the
change that needs the `bot` self-label reconsidered, and profile.md holds that reasoning.
