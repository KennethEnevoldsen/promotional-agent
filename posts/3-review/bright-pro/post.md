```
New benchmark: BRIGHT-Pro adds reasoning-aspect annotations to BRIGHT for agentic search — scored on surfacing several reasoning aspects, not one passage, across 7 StackExchange domains.

19 models score complete already; AQ-MedAI/Diver-Retriever-4B-1020 leads at 55.88.

Added by yilunzhao.
```

## The claim

`mteb#4929` registers `BRIGHT-Pro`: 7 retrieval tasks, one per StackExchange domain
(biology, earth science, economics, psychology, robotics, stackoverflow, sustainable
living). It extends the original `BRIGHT` benchmark with per-query "aspect"
annotations — each query's gold answer cites passages that collectively cover several
distinct reasoning aspects, so a retriever is scored on surfacing an aspect-diverse
evidence set rather than a single relevant passage. Built for agentic search settings,
where an agent needs a spread of evidence to reason over, not just the one nearest
neighbor.

`results#644`, same author, same day, submits day-one results for 19 models — all 19
with complete 7-task coverage, unusually thorough for a benchmark's first results PR.
That completeness is why this is a leaderboard post rather than a bare announcement.

`mteb#5129`, a same-day duplicate re-registration of the same benchmark ("Readd it from
#4929"), is rejected separately — see `rejected/bright-pro-benchmark`.

## What the leaderboard shows

`AQ-MedAI/Diver-Retriever` sweeps 4 of the top 5 spots (4B-1020, 4B, 0.6B, 1.7B — every
size in the family), ahead of `yale-nlp/RTriever-4B` (the benchmark authors' own
reference model, 5th at 46.88) and the general-purpose leaders `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`
(6th, 41.75) and `Alibaba-NLP/gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct` (8th, 37.75). `ReasonIR/ReasonIR-8B`
— a model built specifically for reasoning-intensive retrieval — places 9th at 32.94,
behind several models with no reasoning-specific training at all. Worth noting, not
worth a claim: 19 models on day one is too thin a field to say anything about what kind
of training this benchmark rewards.

## Notes

Credit: yilunzhao (mteb#4929 and results#644, same author). No Bluesky handle in
`social-handles.yaml`, so plain text, no @-mention.

Card shows top 10 of 19 rather than the full board — the bars template's row spacing is
tuned for ~10 rows on the 1200px canvas (see `card-1-bright-pro.html`'s own comment).
`data.json` keeps all 19, per CONTRIBUTING's "record every model that qualified."

First post drafted with `mtebpost/model_release.py`'s bars builder for a
`benchmark_addition` (no single "subject" model — `cohort([], "BRIGHT-Pro")` with an
empty subject list, same builder as `most-embed-de`, just no highlighted row). Found and
fixed a real bug in the process: `bars_card_data`/`pareto_card_data` read the task count
from `coh.subjects[0]`, which doesn't exist when there's no subject — silently printed
"0 tasks" until `Cohort.n_benchmark_tasks` was added to read it from any scored entry.
